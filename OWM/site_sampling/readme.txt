<city.list.joson> has included all possible sites/weather stations to that we can have access.
But Open Weather Map has a restriction regarding the free access. To deal with it we use a suitable sample of 300 observation sites
with a aproxemately equal distributed distance around the location of the 3 surfe spots. 

The script <site_sampler.py> do the sampling stuff and returns a jso file with those sampled observation sites and their 
geodata.
