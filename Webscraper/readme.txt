These two python files define a web scraper that is able to fetch certain wind forecast date within a definable timerange from the
"Windfinder" (see: https://www.windfinder.com ) webserver of specific sites.

Sorry...but i just have to this write this: I wrote defenately not manny scrapers in my life but when, i have always realy struggled with that. 
But to write a scraper for Windfinder webserver was so amazing easy...sorry i should become serious again:D. 

Anyways...

You can find in the script <WF_scraper_class.py> the class definition of the web scraper and to use it the second script <get_forecast_data.py>
is to apply this class to scrape the data and store them as json data onto the drive.
